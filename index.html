                    <p id ="statement"> Children, first and foremost. I am passionate about quality public education and the students/families of MVUSD. As a parent of two MVUSD students and a tireless volunteer throughout MVUSD, I have years of in-depth experience with the issues that matter most to our district. Having worked extensively with the district for nine years through PTA at the school, district and county level, I have served on the LCAP Advisory Committee, the Report Card committee the District ATP and the Counseling Advisory Council. I am committed to ensuring that all stakeholders (students, parents, staff and community members) are heard and recognized when decisions affecting the whole are being made. I am willing to ask the tough questions and demand complete and transparent answers. I will continue to work collaboratively with the staff and employee groups whose expertise and knowledge are indispensable to creating an environment that supports student learning and achievement. As we move forward into an increasingly complex and nuanced educational landscape, I am eager and highly qualified to continue the excellent work already being done in our California Exemplary School District. I ask for your vote so that I can continue to work on behalf of our children.</p>
